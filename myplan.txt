//private graph class built from array of linked lists of nodes
	//do i need LL?
	//single path representing all classes taken
//additional credit requirements
//requirements & mandatory classes in an array

//figure out some way of making sure one of the CHOOSE courses from each line is fulfilled

//node structure
	//const string course name
	//prerequesites
	//additional credit letter
	//if taken in spring vs fall
	//pointer to next node -> outgoing edge to node

//basically write seperate checks:
	//need to make sure there are no loops
	//go through all nodes and make sure mandatory and required courses are taken
//implement graph
	//vector of nodes
	//array length 26 representing dif types of credits required
//implement a vector
//implement a node class
	//const string course name
	//vector of prereqs
	//semester taken in -> if empty then N/A
		//include a check when going through schedule
		//that the course is taken in the semester that it is offered in
		//test that all required classes are taken
	
	//traversed boolean
	//credits it satisfy
