# scheduler

## CS240 Project 3
This command line program takes as input the classes a user would like to take for all 8 semesters. The program then builds a graph 
from the classes, where the classes are the nodes with directed edges representing a class pre-requisite. It uses a DFS
algorithm to check whether the schedule violates any pre-requisites.
